    "\n",
    "* The analysis reveals a gender-based discrepancy in insurance charges, with ***males tending to pay slightly more than females***, approximately $1400 per year. This finding suggests that there are factors influencing the pricing that vary between genders.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For groups with ***no children up to three children, males tend to have lower costs compared to females***. However, for groups with ***four or five children, females tend to have higher costs compared to males***.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* Among the explored factors (age, BMI, smoking) one potential explanation for this difference is the ***tendency of males to have a higher prevalence of obesity*** compared to females. Obesity is known to be a significant risk factor for various diseases, and individuals with obesity are generally considered to be at higher risk, resulting in increased healthcare expenses and potentially higher insurance premiums.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Another contributing factor to the gender-based discrepancy in insurance charges is the ***higher prevalence of smoking among males***. Smoking is widely recognized as a major risk factor for several health conditions, which can lead to higher healthcare costs and insurance premiums.\n",
