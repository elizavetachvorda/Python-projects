# Visualization for Exploratory Data Analysis: Airline Analysis

## Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset containing information about flights, including flight duration, passenger count, delays, ticket prices, and other relevant factors. The goal is to gain insights into flight patterns, pricing trends, and factors affecting delays.

## Skills and Techniques Applied

### Data Exploration and Visualization
- Utilized Python libraries such as Pandas and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.
- Generated various plots including histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and count plots to visualize distributions, relationships, and trends in the data.
- Explored the dataset's structure, summary statistics, and variable distributions to gain a deeper understanding of the data.

### Statistical Analysis
- Conducted statistical analysis to calculate descriptive statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and quartiles to summarize the dataset.
- Utilized hypothesis testing techniques such as chi-square tests and contingency table analysis to investigate associations between categorical variables.

### Interpretation and Communication
- Interpreted analysis results to extract meaningful insights and draw actionable conclusions.
- Communicated findings through visualizations, summary statistics, and descriptive narratives to convey key insights effectively.
