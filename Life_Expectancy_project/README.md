# Economic Trends and Human Well-being: A Comparative Analysis of GDP and Life Expectancy

## Overview
This project explores the relationship between life expectancy and GDP across various countries over time. It applies statistical analysis techniques, data visualization, and correlation analysis to gain insights into how economic prosperity affects health outcomes.

## Skills Applied
- Data analysis using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
- Statistical analysis including quartiles, interquartile range, correlation coefficients, and hypothesis testing.
- Data visualization techniques to represent distributions, trends, and correlations.

## Key Findings
1. **Distribution Analysis**: The data exhibits right-skewed distributions for GDP and left-skewed distributions for life expectancy, indicating important patterns and variability.
2. **Variation Across GDP Levels**: Differences in life expectancy distribution are observed across different GDP levels, with narrower interquartile ranges in high GDP countries.
3. **Mean GDP and Life Expectancy Across Countries**: Disparities in economic and health indicators are evident, with notable variations in mean GDP and mean life expectancy among different countries.
4. **Trends Over Time**: Gradual growth in average GDP and consistent increases in average life expectancy are observed over the years, with minor fluctuations.
5. **Correlation Between GDP and Life Expectancy**: Strong positive correlations between GDP and life expectancy are found across countries, highlighting the significant influence of economic development on health outcomes.

## Conclusion
The analysis underscores the critical interplay between economic prosperity and health outcomes, with strong correlations observed between GDP and life expectancy across various countries. These findings can inform policy decisions aimed at promoting economic growth and improving public health globally.
