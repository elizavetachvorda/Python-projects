# Audiobook Dataset Cleaning Project

## Overview

This project focuses on cleaning and preparing a dataset containing information about audiobooks. The primary goal is to ensure data consistency, eliminate duplicates, and format columns for effective analysis.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Data Exploration and Cleaning:** Identified and addressed issues such as duplicates, inconsistent prefixes in 'author' and 'narrator' columns, and non-uniform language capitalization.

- **Column Transformation:** Processed 'time' and 'releasedate' columns to more suitable formats. Split the 'stars' column into 'stars' and 'ratings' for numeric representation.

- **Regular Expressions:** Applied regular expressions to extract relevant information, such as numeric values in the 'price' column.

- **Data Type Conversion:** Converted data types to ensure proper representation (e.g., 'price' column from object to float).

- **Dataframe Manipulation:** Utilized pandas functions to drop unnecessary columns and facilitate data analysis.

## Conclusion

The dataset is now cleaned, consistent, and ready for further analysis. This project demonstrates proficiency in Python programming, data manipulation, and the application of regular expressions for effective data cleaning.
